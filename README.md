### Food Hamper Demand Prediction

#### Summary:
Developed a predictive model to estimate the number of food hampers required in specific geographical areas. The project also explored the correlation between hamper demand and holiday seasons.

#### Features:
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
- Built regression models to predict hamper demand.
- Visualized trends and insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

#### Key Code Snippets:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Example of data preprocessing
data = pd.read_csv("food_hamper_data.csv")
data_cleaned = data.dropna()

# Model training
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(data_cleaned["features"], data_cleaned["target"])
```

### Kijiji Data Analysis

#### Summary:
Analyzed data from the Kijiji platform to extract insights and trends. This project involved data scraping, cleaning, and exploratory analysis.

#### Features:
- Performed data scraping to collect classified ads data.
- Processed text data to extract key attributes like price, location, and description.
- Visualized patterns in the dataset to uncover trends.

#### Repository:

#### Key Code Snippets:
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Example of data scraping
url = "https://www.kijiji.ca/"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
data = soup.find_all('div', class_='item-info')
```

### NPRI Substance Release Prediction

#### Summary:
Predicted the release of specific substances by companies over time using time series forecasting. This project aimed to model future scenarios for regulatory and environmental planning.

#### Features:
- Processed historical release data to prepare time series inputs.
- Built and optimized forecasting models using ARIMA and LSTM.
- Evaluated scenarios to understand the impact of regulatory changes.

#### Repository:

#### Key Code Snippets:
```python
from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import ARIMA

# Example of time series modeling
model = ARIMA(data, order=(1, 1, 1))
model_fit = model.fit(disp=0)
forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=10)
```
